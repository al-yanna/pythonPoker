# pythonPoker
This program evaluates what type of poker hand the input is in order of ranking. Each hand is represented by a string of 10 characters, each 2 characters represent a card: the rank and its suit (For example, a Queen of Spades is "Qs" and a hand would be "Qs7s2s4s5s"). The rankings included are as follows:
  1. Full house: Three of a kind with a pair.
  2. Four of a kind: All four cards of the same rank.
  3. Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank.
  4. Pair: Two cards of the same rank.
  5. Flush: Any five cards of the same suit, but not in a sequence.
  6. High Card: The highest card plays.

## Updates
